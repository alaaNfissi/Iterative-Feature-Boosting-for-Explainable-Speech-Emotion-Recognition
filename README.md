<!-- ABSTRACT -->
## Abstract

<p align="justify"> We present a new method for speech emotion recognition (SER) based on carefully engineered features of the voice and their statistical characteristics values. We pay particular attention to the explainability of our results, using methods for estimating the importance of individual features in a classification machine learning model in order to refine our features selection process. This, in turn, enhances the overall performance of our SER system. On the other hand, randomly computing features without considering their importance in SER can lead to including irrelevant or redundant information, which can reduce the performance of the model and lead to less accurate predictions. It also can make the model more complex and computationally expensive, leading to longer processing times and increased memory usage. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider and analyze the features used in SER systems in order to build models that are able to accurately and reliably predict emotions from speech signals. To do this, we first compute a set of speech features believed to be useful for emotion recognition. Then, we use principal component analysis (PCA) to select the best combinations of features that capture the most information in the data. The final feature set consists of the principal components of each selected combination. We train and fine tune an Extra Trees classifier on the refined feature set to obtain robust predictions. Additionally, we incorporate explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods to understand the role each feature plays in the predictions. By using Shapley values, we can optimize the feature selection process and improve the overall performance of the SER system through an iterative feedback loop. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches as we provide a comprehensive way in the area of SER and XAI that aims to balance the benefits of advanced machine learning techniques with the need for transparency and comprehensibility for better results. The proposed method is evaluated on TESS dataset. </p>
