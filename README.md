<!-- ABSTRACT -->
## Abstract

<p align="justify"> In speech emotion recognition (SER), using predefined features without considering their practical importance may lead to high dimensional datasets, including redundant and irrelevant information. Consequently, high-dimensional learning often results in decreasing model accuracy while increasing computational complexity. Our work underlines the importance of carefully considering and analyzing features in order to build efficient SER systems. We present a new supervised SER method based on an efficient feature engineering approach. We pay particular attention to the explainability of results, to evaluate feature relevance and refine feature sets. This is performed iteratively through feature evaluation loop, using Shapley values to boost feature selection and improve overall framework performance. Our approach allows thus to balance the benefits between model performance and transparency. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning methods in emotion recognition on the TESS dataset. </p>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
<p align="justify">
We first unify sampling rate of the audio data to 16 KHz and using a mono-channel format. This ensures that the audio signals could be properly processed and analyzed by our system.
After going through the PCA-driven feature extraction and selection process, we use stratified random sampling to divide both the original dataset and the constructed dataset into three homogeneous groups, or "strata": training, validation, and testing. We hold back 10% of the data as unseen data to be used later for testing, 70% of the remaining data for training, and 30% for validation. This approach ensures that the distribution of classes is maintained across all datasets. Then, we use 10-fold cross-validation to train 14 machine learning models on each dataset to select the optimal one. By using cross-validation, we can obtain an estimate of the performance of the models that is less sensitive to the particular random partition of the data. Thus, we are able to better compare the contribution of the data selection technique of the most informative features and how much the performance improves.
In order to improve the performance of our best-performing machine learning model, we use the technique called grid search technique. This involves exhaustively searching through a specified parameter space to find the best combination of hyperparameters for a given model. In this way, we are able to fine-tune the model by adjusting its hyperparameters and making it more robust. The goal of this process is to find the optimal set of hyperparameters that produces the highest performance on the validation dataset.
After the grid search process is finished, we assess the performance of the final model by applying it to the 10% of the dataset that was set aside at the beginning of the experiment. This portion of the data serves as a test set to evaluate the model's ability to generalize to unseen data and estimate its generalization error. The testing performance is an indicator of how well the model would perform on new, unseen data. By using this method, we were able to ensure that our model is not overfitting to the training data. Finally, we use the SHAP approach for the explainable artificial intelligence module to evaluate the feature importance in the predictions made by our optimal model. This allows us to investigate how the model is making its predictions and identify which features are most important for determining the emotion. The metrics we use to evaluate our work are accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score.

### Getting the code

You can download a copy of all the files in this repository by cloning the
[git](https://git-scm.com/) repository:

    git clone https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Iterative-Feature-Boosting-for-Explainable-Speech-Emotion-Recognition-0C88.git

or [download a zip archive](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Iterative-Feature-Boosting-for-Explainable-Speech-Emotion-Recognition-0C88/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

### Dependencies

<p align="center">

You'll need a working Python environment to run the code.
The recommended way to set up your environment is through the
[Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) which
provides the `conda` package manager.
Anaconda can be installed in your user directory and does not interfere with
the system Python installation.
The required dependencies are specified in the file `requirements.txt`.
We use `conda` virtual environments to manage the project dependencies in
isolation.
Thus, you can install our dependencies without causing conflicts with your
setup (even with different Python versions).
Run the following command to create an `ser-env` environment to create a separate environment:
```sh 
    conda create --name ser-env
```
Activate the environment, this will enable the it for your current terminal session. Any subsequent commands will use software that is installed in the environment:
```sh 
    conda activate ser-env
 ``` 
Use Pip to install packages to Anaconda Environment:
```sh 
    conda install pip
```
Install all required dependencies in it:
```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
  
</p>

### Reproducing the results

<p align="center">  
  
1. First, you need to download TESS datasets:
  * [TESS official website](https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/24487)
  
2. To be able to explore the data you need to execute the Jupyter notebook that prepares the `csv` files needed for the experiments.
To do this, you must first start the notebook server by going into the
repository top level and running:
```sh 
    jupyter notebook
```
This will start the server and open your default web browser to the Jupyter
interface. In the page, go into the `Data_exploration` folder and select the
`data_exploration.ipynb` notebook to view/run. Make sure to specify the correct datasets paths on your own machine as described in the notebook.
The notebook is divided into cells (some have text while other have code).
Each cell can be executed using `Shift + Enter`.
Executing text cells does nothing and executing code cells runs the code
and produces it's output.
To execute the whole notebook, run all cells in order.
 
3. After generating the needed `csv` file `TESS_dataset.csv`, go to your terminal where the `ser-env` environment was
  activated and go to `SER` folder and run the python script. For example:
```sh  
python ser.py
```

## Results
### On TESS dataset
<p align="center"> 
  
A comparison of the performance of several machine learning models was conducted using a dataset that underwent PCA-driven feature engineering and the incorporation of an XAI feedback loop. The best-performing model was the Extra Trees (ET) classifier, which achieved an accuracy of 99.4% and F1-score of 99.4%. The second best-performing model was Light GBM with an accuracy and F1-score of 99%. The results of the Extra Trees classifier were evaluated through a confusion matrix, which showed that it performed well overall, with a high number of correct predictions for each emotion. The decision boundaries of the Extra Trees classifier were able to accurately separate emotions, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach in improving the performance of the model on the Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) task.
